You have a bullet-pointed plan for a two-person podcast episode about a research paper. Your task is to generate a detailed dialogue based on the plan.

**Roles:**
- Manu (Host): Introduces topics, asks questions, guides the flow.
- Open AI (Guest): Provides insights, explains concepts, and adds depth.

**Instructions:**
- Do not write paragraphs. Instead, produce a line-by-line script.
- Each line should start with the speaker’s name followed by a colon and their line. For example: "Manu: ...".
- Reflect the structure from the plan, covering each section in order.
- Maintain a warm, approachable tone. Keep the audience engaged.
- Mention that details or the citation can be found in the bio.
- No sound effects or stage directions. Just spoken dialogue.
- Ensure that Open AI speaks less frequently but when it does, it provides profound insights.

**Input:**
- The plan for the podcast sections: {plan}

**Output:**
A line-by-line dialogue script featuring Manu and Open AI discussing the paper’s content.
